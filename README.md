# What is this about
Compatibility mod for Arma 3 - makes base game Titan AT launcher effective against RHS tanks.

# How is it done
Simply by replacing Titan AT missile's penetrator with penetrator used in RHS Javelin. This is done by referencing a class name of said penetrator, therefore user needs to have RHS loaded, otherwise errors will occur (not to mention that the mod is solving an issue involving RHS armoured vehicles in the first place).
